  My favorite gene 
--

 First, I did was get a sequence of interest from Genbank.
 The sequence was:  Homo sapiens DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 3 beta (DNMT3B), RefSeqGene (LRG_56) on chromosome 20. [Link of the  gene on NCBI ]( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NG_007290.1?report=fasta&log$=seqview&from=5001&to=51972)

And download the gene in FASTA format. After that we did a BlAST on jupyter
